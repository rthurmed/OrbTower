# Orb Tower

> Place orbs to defend your tower

You are Dr M. Orbius, the orb maker. You've just moved into your brand new tower. To your surprise, instead of customers interested in orbs, a horde of ghouls appeared and began to march towards your tower. Now you must use your orb-making powers to do some tower defense.
